# TV_Script_Generator

The TV_Script_Generator wll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. It wll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

In this project, we will use a LSTM cell.
